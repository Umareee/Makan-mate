This type of catering is ideal for more intimate gatherings like small-scale office parties, birthday parties and family reunions with less than 20 guests.

Even if a recipe only takes 45 minutes to cook, there is a list of hidden tasks that recipe blogs don’t account for. This is what preparing a home-cooked meal would look like. First, you consider everyone’s dietary restrictions and preferences, next decide on what to cook, and then figure out the ideal portion size so that you can fill everyone without too much leftovers. Once that is clear, you make a grocery list and find out which supermarkets you can find the ingredients at and make a trip there. Then, you prepare the ingredients and start cooking ahead of time. Once you’ve cleaned up, you can focus on the final touches to get your party ready. When the guests arrive, it’s time to reheat the food and serve it. Fingers crossed that they enjoy the spread! Let’s compare it to engaging mini buffet catering. You simply go to the caterer’s website, choose the menu, fill in your special requests, book a date and time and wait for the food, cutlery and disposables to arrive on the day. Be worry-free and leave the cooking and delivery to Makan Mate so you can save your time and energy for mingling with your guests and enjoying the festivities."

Cooked in a halal-certified kitchen, you can get the most out of Korean soups, salads, meats, and noodles while making sure it is completely halal and that dishes can be swapped out to provide vegan or vegetarian options at your request.

Here are some tips to help you find the perfect mini buffet catering service for your event. Consider your budget: Determine how much you can afford to spend on catering and make sure to find a caterer that fits nicely within your budget. With the right caterer, you can spend well within your means while serving your guests the best. Know your party: Next, think about the type of event you’re hosting. Will it be a formal or casual affair? Will there be a specific theme or cuisine that you want to serve? Make sure to choose a catering service that can accommodate what your party is about. Get a reputable caterer: When it comes to choosing a caterer, reputation is key. Do your research and read reviews on Google and Facebook to get a sense of previous clients’ experience with the caterer. Ask your friends and family for caterers they have engaged in the past. Another important factor to consider is the quality of the food. Look for a caterer that uses fresh, high-quality ingredients and is flexible to accommodate dietary restrictions or preferences. Logistics: Don’t forget about the logistics! Make sure that the catering service can deliver to your venue at the date and time that you need. Check the terms of the delivery to see if the caterer provides disposable plates, utensils and cups so you can make the necessary arrangements. If the caterer also has a full table set-up with warmers, they may have a cut-off time when they will collect the trays back so keep that in mind when deciding when to serve the food. For mini catering services, you may not need all the fancy table set-ups since it is a small party. With these tips in mind, finding the right mini buffet catering service for your event should be a breeze. At Makan Mate, we are honoured to be the trusted catering partner for many corporate events, birthday parties, festive celebrations and family gatherings through the years. With a long list of menu options, you are sure to find a mini buffet catering option that sits within your budget, and suits your guests’ requirements. Our mini catering is served in aluminium trays so you don’t have to worry about a collection time to return anything."

        "title": "Tips for Hosting an Intimate Gathering",
        "content": "Here’s a guide to all the other elements that go into planning and hosting a party so you won’t miss out on anything: Plan ahead of time: Don’t just wing it, plan it. Decide on the vibe you want to create and make sure you have everything you need to pull it off. Whether it’s a cozy gathering or a funky costume party, make sure you have the right decor, guest list and music to set the tone. Let your guests know ahead of time how to get to the venue and inform them of the parking options available. Get the place ready: Taking the time to decorate your venue helps to put you in the mood to party. There is something about getting the ladder out of the storeroom to hang up lights and streamers that signals to your mind that it is time for celebration. Getting simple decorations from Daiso or setting up a photo wall can transform your space into a party venue from the moment your guests step in. Choosing a Spotify playlist to play through the party does so much more than set the mood. When guests are streaming in and the party hasn’t quite started yet, it helps to fill in awkward silences – especially between guests who don’t know each other well. Welcome your guests: Once the doorbell starts ringing, it’s time to swing into action. As your guests arrive, be sure to be the familiar face that greets them and shows them around the space. Along the way, make introductions if necessary so they can start mingling. Have simple activities: Giving your guests something to do (apart from eating and drinking) will bring life to the party – even if they do not know each other. Your guests have the chance to bond with each other as they play simple card games, board games or Nintendo Switch games that can be suitable for all ages. If you see someone looking out of place, you can ask them to accompany you to do simple tasks like following you to buy more ice cubes for the party. Hopefully, they will feel more at ease when they are with a familiar face. Thank your guests: Last but not least, don’t forget to say your thanks to your guests on their way out. Let them know that you appreciate that they have carved out time in their day to celebrate with you. Offer to give them some of the leftovers to bring to their families so they know that you thought of them. Pat yourself on the back: You did it. You hosted the party that you’d been planning for months. Whether things went according to plan or not, you shared your gift of hospitality with your friends and family. It’s time to clean up and relax."

Using utensils and cookware that have come into contact with non-halal food can make your guests uncomfortable, even if you don’t serve pork at your event.

When animals are slaughtered for food, it must be done in a way that minimizes their pain and suffering. The Islamic method of animal sacrifice is regarded as one of the most compassionate because it entails a quick, precise slash to the neck that results in instantaneous death.
